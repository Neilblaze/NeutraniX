## Abstract

This module is a part of the project that aims to develop a mobile head motion-tracking unit based on RCV (Realtime Computer Vision) for specially-abled people. The unit will be able to track the head motion of the user and send the data to a remote server. The data will be used to control the movement of the cursor on screen. All of the computations are being performed on-device itself to reduce latency, amplifying the efficiency of the system. The system is designed to be portable and can be used in any environment, even in low-light conditions.
